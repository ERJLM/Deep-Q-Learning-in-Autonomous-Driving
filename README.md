# Deep-Q-Learning-in-Autonomous-Driving
## About the project:
Check the project report ("Final_Report_Internship.pdf").
## Instructions
- Run the train_seg_binary code to generate and train the segmentation model (it will generate a model named "model-seg-binary"). The model will train for 1000 epochs.
- Run the test_seg_binary code to test the model's accuracy (optional but highly recommended)
- Run the agent_bynary code with the model's name as an argument, for example: "python agent_binary --model model-seg-binary"
